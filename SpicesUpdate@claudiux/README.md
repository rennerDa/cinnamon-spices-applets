# Spices Update

## Summary

Cinnamon Spices are Applets, Desklets, Extensions and Themes.

You usually check updates for the Spices using Cinnamon Settings. But, like me, you do it too seldom.

The **Spices Update** applet plays these roles:

  * It warns you when the Spices you have installed need updates.
  * It gives you direct access to Cinnamon Settings for Applets, Desklets, Extensions and Themes.

## Status

Fully supported by the author, under continuing development and in continuous use on several machines, running with **Linux Mint**, **Fedora** or **Archlinux**.

## Requirements

The Spices Update requires the tool ```notify-send```.

To install it:

  * Fedora: ```sudo dnf install libnotify```
  * Arch: ```sudo pacman -Syu libnotify```
  * Linux Mint: ```sudo apt install libnotify-bin```

**This applet helps you to install this dependency, if any.**

## Settings

There are five tabs in settings.

The first, _General_, allows you to:

  * Select the _Time interval between two checks_ (in hours). Please note that the first check will take place one minute after starting this applet.
  * Select the ways to warn you : changing the appearance (by color changing) of the icon of this applet and/or displaying messages in the notification zone.
  * Select the _Type of display_ of the icon: with or without text?

For the content of the other tabs (_Applets_, _Desklets_, etc), please look  at the screenshot above and note that **the list of installed Spices is automatically filled** at startup, but a button allows you to reload it.

Set to _FALSE_ all the Spices you _do not want_ to check updates. There are two reasons to do this:

  * A spice is OK for you, and you do not want to be notified of any changes to it.
  * You are a developer working on a spice and you do not want to be informed about changes during development.

## Menu

In the menu of this applet:

  * a Refresh button allows you to force checking the availability of updates for your Spices;
  * a dot appears in front of each type of Spice when at least one update is available;
  * a click on a type of Spice (Applets, Desklets, etc) opens the corresponding page in Cinnamon Settings;
  * a Configure... button opens the Settings.

## Icon

The color of the icon changes when at least one of your Spices needs an update.

Its tooltip (the message displayed when the icon is hovered) contains the list of spices to update, if any.
